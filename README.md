# Rock-of-Ages
Rock of Ages Game Development Using Unity and C# Programming

In this game, the following things happen:
1. New rocks are spawned in the center of the window with a random rock (randomness can result in multiple rocks with the same rock sprite in a row)

2. New rocks immediately start moving with a random velocity

3. A new rock is spawned approximately every second until there are 3 rocks

4. There are never more than 3 rocks in the window

5. Rocks that leave the window are replaced with a new rock spawned in the center of the window with random rock sprite and random velocity after no more than 1 second
